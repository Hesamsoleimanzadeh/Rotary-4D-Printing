Create a Folder for Supplementary Algorithms:
Create a dedicated folder named Re-entrant and an other folder named spiral.

Organize Files:
Place the Supplementary Algorithm 1 files in Re-entrant and Supplementary Algorithm 2 files in Spiral in this folder.

Open Rhino. Write "Grasshopper" in command bar. Inside Grasshopper environment, drag .gh files to use the algorithms.

Refer to the supplementary file for manual.
